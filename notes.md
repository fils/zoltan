# Notes


Certain terms or searches could be associated with a URL pattern.  Essentially 
an automated "blog" or sorts.   These could then have schema.org feed types
and properties used in it.  

It is interesting to see how this compares to something like the Streamlit/Dash
dashboard concept we are exploring in other locations.
