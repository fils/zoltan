# Zoltan

## About

Just exploring a simple Go code to listen for and
respond to WebHook calls.  Exploring some 
of the applications with various groups.  

It will never be as cool at the 
real [Zoltan](http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/zoltan.htm) though!  


## Test command notes

```bash
‚ùØ curl -X POST  --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"  'http://localhost:6789/query'  --data @./docs/testPackage.txt
Zoltan is on it!%     
```
